= NOTE

This is currently in Alpha Version and isn't fully functional.  Currently, you can only conduct an Entity search and get the raw_json back.

I am quickly developing this into a fully featured gem that supports the full MQL queries offered by GeoAPI.com, so expect frequent updates until a major point release is reached.

= GeoAPI

A Ruby wrapper for the GeoAPI.com APIs.  This gem was almost entirely inspired by the various geoplanet gems.

== Usage

=== Reverse Geocoding:

  require 'geoapi'
  GeoAPI.apikey = [Your App ID Here]
  
  # Location
  latitude = -27.000
  longitude = -131.000
  
  # Non Required Options
  optional_parameters = {:radius => '500m', :type => 'POI', :include_parents => true, :limit => 5, :pretty => true}
  
  # Lookup
  entities = GeoAPI::Entity.search(latitude, longitude, optional_parameters)
  

  
=== Views
  
  require 'geoapi'
  GeoAPI.apikey = [Your App ID Here]


== REQUIREMENTS:

To use this library, you must have a valid GeoAPI.com API Key. 
You can get one at http://api.geoapi.com

Additionally, geoapi has the following gem dependencies:

* rest-client >= 0.9
* json >= 1.1.3

Please note that if you have ActiveSupport::JSON defined (either by
manually having loaded it or when you use geoapi within a Rails
application) the json dependency will be ignored and geoapi uses
ActiveSupport::JSON instead.

== INSTALL:

  gem install geoapi --source http://gems.github.com
